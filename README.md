# WebPlayer
HTML based music player

Upload a folder that contains audio files and it will turn the folder into an album. If there is an image in the folder it will select it as the cover and if there is multiple images you can click on the image in the album view to change it. It will display nested folders that also contain music as separate albums. 

Mobile users must drag a folder into the upload prompt if it does not allow the selection of folders for upload.

Audio will skip to the next song if your browser does not support the specific format (for example opus is not suported in Safari). 

Add to queue function coming in the future :O
